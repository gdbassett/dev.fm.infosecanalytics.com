  A quick introduction to Flow Manager 
---

Hi! You're here early!  We've only just made Flow Manager public as we start enrolling folks in the beta!

Still, since you're here, stick around.  We'd like to share a bit.  Honestly, we're a bit proud.  Flow Manager is something we've been thinking about for a while.  But let's back up.

We've been thinking about how to bring graphs to infosec for a while now. The first thoughts date back about a decade when Information Security Analytics was founded.  In 2013, we received [our first patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9292695B1/).

Since then we've spent a lot of time thinking about how to best represent security data using graphs.  We've tried various things (many documented [in our blog](http://infosecanalytics.com/blog/)).  Some have worked, others did not.

The work culminated in the Attack Flow project in 2021.  In it we build a standard based on decades of experience across multiple organizations and is truly well thought out standard.

But while the project produced a schema and an ability to create a flow, it turns out a flow is not necessarily useful, _flows_ are useful.  To that end we've introducing **Flow Manager**.  Flow Manager lets you store your flows in a single place and extract them in aggregate for analysis.

At this point, it's just in beta.  Its not quite ready for prime time.  We're working to improve the documentation, hunt any bugs that have so far remained hidden, get feedback from early adopters, and overall prepare it for general availability.

Still, follow this site as we get closer to that 1.0 version.  And if you're interested in participating in the beta, [get in touch!](http://infosecanalytics.com/contact/)!
