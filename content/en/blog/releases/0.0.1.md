**FEATURES**
 * '/flows' POST API endpoint for uploading flows
   * Accepts flow manager V1 flows
   * Corrects defaults inherent in Flow Builder 1
   * Validates the json-schema against the Attack Flow 1 schema, converts it to a RDF graph, validates it against the Attack Flow SCHACL schema, and stores it in a private named graph.
   * Also accepts RDF attack Flow graphs and SPARQL queries which result in valid attack flow graphs
 * '/flows' GET API endpoint for querying flows
   * Accepts a valid SPARQL read query
   * Returns the query results as JSON (NOTE: sparql queries do not necessarily return an RDF graph and so the results must be parsed dependent on the query used)
 * Documentation of the API can be found at the [Flow Manager API Reference]({{< ref "docs/Reference/flow_manager_api.md" >}})
