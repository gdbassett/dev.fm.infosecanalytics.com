Welcome to the Flow Manager documentation page.  These pages will introduce you to what you need to get know to get started with flow manager.  They currently focus on the specific tasks associated with Flow Manager, but will expand to provide tutorials in using attack flow for the various tasks we encounter in information security.

If you already have an access token, you can start with the Getting Started section.

If you are new to knowledge graphs, you may want to start with the Concepts section.

As you start to think about how you want to use Flow Manager, the Tasks section can help you out.

The References provide details on the API.

And if you're not sure which of these applies.  Start with the Overview.

If you have questions or concerns, _please reach out_!  You can find us on [Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@infosecanalytics) or contact us [through our website](http://infosecanalytics.com/contact/).  Thank you for joining the Attack Flow community.  We look forward to working with you!
