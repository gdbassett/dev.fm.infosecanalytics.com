Flow Manager provides three core capabilities:
 - [Write flows](docs/Tasks/write_flows.md) to the database
 - [Modify flows](docs/Tasks/modify_flows.md) (under construction)
 - [Read triples](docs/Tasks_read_flows.md) from the database. (this may be triples, but it may non-triple queries such as returning the created date for all flows.)


These three steps form the basic building blocks of the use cases laid out in the [Tutorial](docs/Tutorial) section.
