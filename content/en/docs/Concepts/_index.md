To use and get the most out of Flow Manager, it's helpful to understand a few key technologies.

 - [Knowledge Graphs](docs/Concepts/knowledge_graphs/) - Provides a brief introduction to graphs and the specific type used by Flow Builder
 - [Attack Flows](docs/Concepts/attack_flow/) - Provides basic definitions of attack flows and their conceptual use.
 - [Flow Builder](docs/Concepts/flow_builder_v1/) - Provides a detailed walk through for craeting flows in the FLow Builder V1 webapp produced by the Mitre Engiunity Center for Threat Informed Defense (CTID).
 - [SPARQL](docs/Concepts/sparql.md) - SPARQL is a query language for graphs.  Flow Builder uses SPARQL as the primary way to retrieve flow data from the graph database.  This tutorial provides several useful query examples covering key concepts.
 - [SPARQL Create](docs/Concepts/sparql_create.md) SPARQL can also be used to create flows. This quick example will show you how.
